# Low-cost-tendon-driven-SR

**NOTE: This repository is still under construction**

## Overview

This repository provides the files and instructions to manufacture low-cost soft robots driven by tendons, like the ones shown below: 

![allunits](https://github.com/PabloBorja/Low-cost-tendon-driven-SR/assets/78549859/a81d640a-252f-4855-b7cd-5481bdafda04)


The proposed designs focus on the following design features:

1. Low manufacturing costs.
2. Accessible fabrication methods.
3. Simple assembly processes.
4. An open-source approach.
5. Durability and easy maintenance.

These systems can be used for teaching and research purposes. Additionally, you can create fun applications with additional electronics or robotics knowledge. So, hobbyists are also welcome.

## Manufacturing Your Robots

The folder "files" contains all the files required to produce the units. We provide source and ready-to-go files. You can use the latter if you are happy with the design or modify the source files to tailor the robots to your needs. 

In the "manual" folder, you will find a document with instructions on how to assemble the units.

## Funding, Publications, and Contact

The soft robots discussed in this repository were designed at the University of Plymouth, where the UKRI funded the research activities. Grant Reference **EP/X525789/1**.
